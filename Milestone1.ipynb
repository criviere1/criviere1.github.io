    "# Project Goals\n",
    "The team, **Collette Riviere and Toby Mendels**, will likely be investigating data sets related to covid-19 infection rates, vaccine hesitancy rates, political opinions, and more. Most of the data will come from the US Census Bureau, specifically the Household Pulse Survey. From this survey, we are interested in vaccine hesitancy by county and state The Covid-19 vaccine was a devicive issue for many people so looking at vaccine hesitency before the Covid-19 pandemic could help indicate which who and what parts of the US were most reluctant or hesitant about vaccines. This relates to the second dataset, daily Covid-19 infection reports across cities/states. This dataset can help investigate how Covid-19 spread across the USA from Janurary 2020 to March 2023 and how different states were affected by the pandemic over time. Both datasets in conjunction can help answer questions such as, \"Did states with more vaccine hesitancy have higher rates of Covid-19 infection, especially after the Covid-19 vaccine was released?\" and \"Did vaccines decrease the Covid-19 infection rate (assuming people with little vaccine hesitancy got the Coid-19 vaccine)?\".\n",

    "### Collaboration Plan\n",
    "The team plans to meet every other week to work on this project to finalize the project, discuss next steps, and help each other. We will also be communicating over text messages to update each other with our progress. We have also set up a shared Github repository to house and update our code."
